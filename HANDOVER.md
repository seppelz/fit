## Project Overview

"Fit at Work" is a workplace wellness application focused on quick, simple exercises that can be done at a desk. The app aims to promote regular movement during work hours through short, effective exercises.

### Core Purpose
- Combat the negative effects of prolonged sitting
- Promote regular movement during work hours
- Keep exercises simple and quick (1-2 minutes)
- Focus on exercises that can be done at or near a desk
- Track and visualize muscle development over time

### Current Features

#### 1. Quick Office Exercises
- Duration: 1-2 minutes per exercise
- Categories: Desk, Standing, Floor, Stretching
- Simple instructions
- Progress tracking
- Points and streak system

#### 2. Interactive Body Model
- SVG-based anatomical visualization
- Muscle group selection
- Development level visualization
- Hover and selection effects
- Exercise recommendations by muscle group

#### 3. Development Mode
- No Firebase dependency required
- Mock data for testing
- Scripted development user
- Dummy exercise recommendations

#### 4. Exercise Player
- Visual timer
- Progress steps
- Exercise completion tracking
- Completion statistics
- Muscle development updates

### Next Steps

#### 1. Body Model Enhancements
- Add muscle group labels
- Improve hover animations
- Add development level indicators
- Consider adding exercise preview on hover

#### 2. Exercise Content
- Create exercise database
- Add proper exercise descriptions
- Add exercise images or animations
- Review and adjust exercise durations

#### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- Add proper exercise images
- Improve exercise player interface
- Add loading states
- Implement error handling
- Add muscle development progress charts

#### State Management
- Using Provider for state management
- Separate providers for:
  - User state
  - Exercise progress
  - Muscle groups
  - Muscle development
  - Exercise recommendations

#### Development Mode
To run in development mode:
```bash
flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart
```

#### Body Model Implementation
The interactive body model uses SVG paths for accurate muscle group visualization. Each muscle group is represented by a complex path that includes anatomical details like:
- Main muscle mass
- Muscle separation lines
- Anatomical landmarks
- Development level indicators

The model supports:
- Hover effects for muscle group identification
- Selection for exercise filtering
- Development level visualization through color gradients
- Smooth transitions between states

### Known Issues
- Firebase configuration needed for production mode
- Exercise durations and calorie calculations need adjustment
- Missing proper exercise content and images

### Future Considerations
- Proper exercise content creation
- Video demonstrations
- Company rankings implementation
- Work hour notifications
- User preferences and settings
