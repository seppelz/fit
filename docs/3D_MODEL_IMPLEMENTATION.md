# 3D Model Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Implementation
- [ ] Research and select 3D model format (glTF recommended for web compatibility)
- [ ] Add model_viewer_plus dependency
- [ ] Create basic 3D model screen structure
- [ ] Implement basic model loading
- [ ] Add basic touch controls (rotate, zoom)
- [ ] Create tests for basic functionality

**Testing Criteria:**
- Model loads successfully
- Basic touch controls work
- Performance is acceptable on target devices

## Phase 2: Model Enhancement
- [ ] Create or acquire detailed human model with muscle groups
- [ ] Set up proper lighting and materials
- [ ] Implement muscle group highlighting
- [ ] Add selection capability for muscle groups
- [ ] Create smooth camera transitions
- [ ] Optimize model for mobile performance

**Testing Criteria:**
- Model detail is sufficient
- Highlighting works correctly
- Selection is accurate
- Transitions are smooth

## Phase 3: UI/UX Implementation
- [ ] Design and implement loading animation
- [ ] Add floating control buttons
- [ ] Create exercise selection cards
- [ ] Implement card animations
- [ ] Add haptic feedback
- [ ] Create visual feedback for interactions
- [ ] Implement background blur effects

**Visual Effects to Add:**
- [ ] Muscle group glow effect
- [ ] Selection particle effects
- [ ] Ambient lighting
- [ ] Pulse animations
- [ ] Color gradients
- [ ] Motion parallax

**Testing Criteria:**
- All animations run at 60fps
- UI is intuitive
- Visual feedback is clear
- Effects enhance rather than distract

## Phase 4: Interaction Enhancement
- [ ] Implement double tap to focus
- [ ] Add pinch-to-zoom refinements
- [ ] Create smooth rotation controls
- [ ] Add auto-rotation when idle
- [ ] Implement gesture recognition
- [ ] Add tutorial overlays for first-time users

**Gesture Controls:**
- [ ] Single finger rotation
- [ ] Two finger zoom
- [ ] Double tap focus
- [ ] Long press for details
- [ ] Swipe for quick view change

**Testing Criteria:**
- Gestures are recognized consistently
- Controls feel natural
- Tutorial is helpful

## Phase 5: Exercise Integration
- [ ] Create exercise-muscle group mapping
- [ ] Implement exercise recommendation logic
- [ ] Design exercise preview cards
- [ ] Add exercise filtering by muscle group
- [ ] Create exercise detail view
- [ ] Implement exercise selection flow

**Data Structure:**
```dart
class MuscleGroup {
  String id;
  String name;
  List<Point3D> highlightPoints;
  List<Exercise> exercises;
}

class Exercise {
  String id;
  String name;
  List<String> muscleGroups;
  String difficulty;
  int duration;
  String description;
}
```

**Testing Criteria:**
- Exercise recommendations are relevant
- Selection flow is intuitive
- Data structure is efficient

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement progressive loading
- [ ] Add model caching
- [ ] Optimize texture loading
- [ ] Implement background data loading
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Create fallback modes for lower-end devices

**Performance Targets:**
- Initial load < 2 seconds
- Interaction response < 16ms
- Memory usage < 100MB
- Smooth animations on mid-range devices

## Phase 7: Polish and Refinement
- [ ] Add advanced visual effects
- [ ] Refine animations
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests
- [ ] Optimize for different screen sizes

**Final Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Performance testing on various devices
- [ ] Memory leak testing
- [ ] Error handling verification
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] UI/UX user testing

## Implementation Notes

### Key Classes to Create:
1. `BodyModelScreen` - Main screen container
2. `ModelViewer` - 3D model display widget
3. `MuscleGroupSelector` - Interaction handler
4. `ExerciseCard` - Exercise display
5. `AnimationController` - Custom animation handler
6. `EffectsManager` - Visual effects controller

### State Management:
```dart
class BodyModelState {
  MuscleGroup? selectedMuscle;
  bool isRotating;
  double zoom;
  List<Exercise> currentExercises;
  bool isLoading;
}
```

### Directory Structure:
```

├── screens/
│   └── body_model/
│       ├── body_model_screen.dart
│       ├── widgets/
│       │   ├── model_viewer.dart
│       │   ├── exercise_card.dart

├── models/
│   ├── muscle_group.dart
│   └── exercise.dart
└── providers/
    └── body_model_provider.dart
```

### Visual Effects Implementation:
1. Use CustomPainter for particle effects
2. Implement shader effects for glow
3. Use AnimationController for smooth transitions
4. Implement custom clipping for cards

### Performance Tips:
1. Use isolates for heavy computations
2. Implement proper widget rebuilding strategy
3. Use RepaintBoundary wisely
4. Cache computed values
5. Use lazy loading for exercises
