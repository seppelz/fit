- Selection is accurate
- Transitions are smooth

## Phase 3: UI/UX Implementation
- [x] Design and implement loading animation
- [x] Add floating control buttons
- [x] Create exercise selection cards
- [x] Implement card animations
- [x] Add haptic feedback
- [x] Create visual feedback for interactions
- [x] Implement background blur effects

**Visual Effects to Add:**
- [x] Muscle group glow effect
- [x] Selection particle effects
- [x] Ambient lighting
- [x] Pulse animations
- [x] Color gradients
- [x] Motion parallax

**Testing Criteria:**
- All animations run at 60fps

- [x] Add pinch-to-zoom refinements
- [x] Create smooth rotation controls
- [x] Add auto-rotation when idle
- [x] Implement gesture recognition
- [x] Add tutorial overlays for first-time users

**Gesture Controls:**
- [x] Single finger rotation
- [x] Two finger zoom
- [x] Double tap focus
- [x] Long press for details
- [x] Swipe for quick view change

**Testing Criteria:**
- Gestures are recognized consistently
- Controls feel natural
- Tutorial is helpful

## Phase 5: Exercise Integration
- [x] Create exercise-muscle group mapping
- [x] Implement exercise recommendation logic
- [x] Design exercise preview cards
- [x] Add exercise filtering by muscle group
- [x] Create exercise detail view
- [x] Implement exercise selection flow

**Data Structure:**
```dart
class MuscleGroup {
  String id;
  String name;
  List<Point3D> highlightPoints;
  List<Exercise> exercises;
}

class Exercise {
  String id;
  String name;
  List<String> muscleGroups;
  String difficulty;
  int duration;
  String description;
}
```

**Testing Criteria:**
- Exercise recommendations are relevant
- Selection flow is intuitive
- Data structure is efficient

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization
- [x] Implement progressive loading
- [x] Add model caching
- [x] Optimize texture loading
- [x] Implement background data loading
- [x] Add loading states
- [x] Create fallback modes for lower-end devices

**Performance Targets:**
- Initial load < 2 seconds
- Interaction response < 16ms
- Memory usage < 100MB
- Smooth animations on mid-range devices

## Phase 7: Polish and Refinement
- [x] Add advanced visual effects
- [x] Refine animations
- [x] Implement error handling
- [x] Add accessibility features
- [x] Create comprehensive tests
- [x] Optimize for different screen sizes

**Final Testing Checklist:**
- [x] Performance testing on various devices
- [x] Memory leak testing
- [x] Error handling verification
- [x] Accessibility testing
- [x] UI/UX user testing

## Implementation Notes

### Current Focus
We are currently working on improving the exercise detail view and the exercise selection system. The main areas of focus are:

1. **Exercise Detail View**
   - Need to properly display exercise information from the database
   - Format descriptions and instructions for better readability
   - Add proper sections for preparation, execution, and tips
   - Implement video playback functionality

2. **Exercise Selection Logic**
   - Currently shows one random exercise per muscle group
   - Need to implement proper filtering based on user preferences
   - Will add exercise history tracking to avoid repetition
   - Plan to add difficulty progression

### Database Structure
The exercise database is structured with German muscle group names:
```sql
CREATE TABLE exercises (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    video_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    preparation TEXT,
    execution TEXT,
    goal TEXT,
    tips TEXT,
    muscle_group TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_sitting BOOLEAN,
    is_theraband BOOLEAN,
    is_dynamic BOOLEAN,
    is_one_sided BOOLEAN
);
```

### Muscle Group Mapping
We maintain a mapping between German and English muscle group names:
- Schulter → Shoulders
- Bauch → Core
- Brust → Chest
- Po → Glutes
- Nacken → Neck
- Rücken → Back

### Next Immediate Tasks
1. Format exercise descriptions properly in the detail view
2. Add proper exercise durations
3. Implement exercise difficulty levels
4. Add user preference based filtering
5. Implement exercise history tracking

### Known Issues
1. Exercise descriptions need proper formatting
2. Exercise durations are currently hardcoded to 3 minutes
3. Exercise difficulty levels not yet implemented
4. User preferences not fully integrated into exercise selection

### Future Enhancements
1. Add exercise variation suggestions
2. Implement exercise scheduling
3. Add exercise reminder notifications
4. Create exercise difficulty progression system
5. Implement comprehensive exercise tracking
